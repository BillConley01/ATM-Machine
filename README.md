# ATM-Machine
Deposit and Withdraw funds from an Account with React
<p>This is the code for a basic ATM Machine made with React. It originated from an assignment in Week #15 of MIT's MERN Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to add select components for Deposit or withdrawals, hide input until deposit or withdrawal is selected, validate input so withdrawals exceeding account values disables the submit button, refractor, personalize features, and add styling.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ol>
<li>React useState is used to maintain state of the list and input values for new items.</li>
<li>Select options added for Deposits or Withdrawals.</li>
<li>Amount Input field disabled until Deposit or Withdrawal is selected.</li>
<li>Input field is cleared after each transaction.</li>
<li>Input and submit components refractored from app.js</li>
  <li>Withdrawals exceeding the account balance are disabled.</li>
</ol>
